# Devillos-playground

Hi! Devillo's playground is a comdedy sandbox site for me to try out new styles of coding and to try and have fun with it. 
It was one of my first projects after getting certified in responvie web design, thus that was the first goal of the site.

Currently I aim to update the site so that "God's Diary" is up for public posting. Anyone can post what the want to the same wall, similar to yik yak
