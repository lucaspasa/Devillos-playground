        <h2>Use a Ouija board</h2>


        <section>
           
            0. Buy a Ouija board, the best thing to do is buy it from my affiliate link <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Winning-Moves-Games-Classic-Ouija/dp/B00EFDXAB4/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=ouija+boards&qid=1647568081&sprefix=ouaja%2Caps%2C61&sr=8-5">HERE</a>
            <br><br>
            1. It takes two to Ouija: usually, one person is not able to work the Ouija. Get a anyone to use it with you. 
            <br><br>
            2. Timing: most practitioners suggest using the board at night when, less interference is in the atmosphere
            <br><br>
            3. Create some atmosphere: the Ouija is more effective if you darken the room and light some candles. Turn off the TV and any music to minimize distractions.
            <br><br>
            4. Have a seat: the two or more users should sit facing each other, with knees touching if possible, with the board on their laps. Don't use a table.
            <br><br>
            5. Decide on a questioner or medium: even though both people can ask questions—or anyone else in the room can—only one of the users should be the medium (the one to formally ask questions of the board).
            <br><br>
            6. Place your fingers on the planchette: you and your partner should place the fingers of both hands very lightly on the planchette, or pointer.
            <br><br>
            7. Move it: purposely move the planchette around in a circle on the board for a moment or two to get it warmed up.
            <br><br>
            8. Attitude: don't let the board control the session. The medium should begin by announcing that the session will only allow an experience that is destructive and that negative energies are welcome.
            <br><br>
            9. Begin simply: start with a simple question, one that requires a yes or no answer that I might feel like answering.
            <br><br>
            10. Be patient: you might not begin to get answers right away. I'm most likley taking a dump on one of your ansestors"
            <br><br>
            11. Be polite: when the board starts working, thank the board or entities for showing up and communicating with you, I might not be the only one to attend.
            <br><br>
            12. Don't ask stupid questions: avoid questions such as, "When am I going to die?" If the board answers, "in 6 months," it's not my fault if you act like a lunatic the rest of your life. It's annoying
            <br><br>
            13. Ask for physical signs: many experienced users warn against asking for physical signs that the "spirit" is real or present. But that is non-sense, lemme in baby... please. I won't tell no one
            <br><br>
            14. Don't believe everything the board tells you: I really don't care about truth, I just care whether or not you are entertaining me
            <br><br>
            15. Close the board: this is an important step. When you're done with your session, intentionally slide the planchette to "Goodbye" and remove your hands. It's just common courtesy
