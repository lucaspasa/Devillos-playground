        Dearest diary, <br><br>
            Today I had a most dreadful thought. What if the first version of the flu I made up, that was much too deadly, become unleashed on the world? 
            Maybe I shouldn't have left it in Wuhan. nah I'm sure it's fine!! <br>
            In other news the groundhog that the humans in Pennsylvannia worship is currently having his day of celebration. I don't know why they celebrate this false god.
            I understand that he is the prognosticator of prognosticators, but DAMN he can't speak :/

        Dearest diary, <br><br>
           Lately I've been thinking a lot about how quickly I made everything. Like, seven days. I know it's 
           impressive. But i've nothing to do now. I did it all. IN SEVEN DAYS. I have an eternity left.
           I have to admit it was really cool seeing Joe Dimagio when he died. But even his endless stories, of
           which I already knew every single one (all knowing god here), eventually got boring. That damned Devillo
           has all the fun!

        Dearest diary, <br><br>
            Do you think the people love me? I hate this social media stuff. Now all they do is marvel at what they have made. The only part of it I can get behind is the thots.
            I MADE THAT. I made those thots. Is this what I'm left to? Making thots so humans appreciate my work? <br>
            What if they don't like me? What if they forget about me? I know I was tough on them in the beginning with the whole sacrifice your son stuff, but come ooooooon
            ....... I  was...... kidding?? Bruh I'm sad.
            <br>
            <br>
            so very lonely.....

            <br>
            <br>
            P.S.
            <br> No all the souls up here don't count. I want what I can't have
